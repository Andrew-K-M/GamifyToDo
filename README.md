# Project: Achievr
## The Goals
Our goal is to gamify the traditional todo app. Traditional todo apps usually have an interface for creating tasks with a due date, priority, and details. The user can mark tasks as completed, in progress, or not started by updating the status. Usually you can sort them into categories, and the more critical tasks are displayed first. We plan on letting the user earn XP when they finish tasks. When the user gains 100/100 XP they will level up. After leveling up a number of times they will gain access to different cosmetics and be able to equip them.
## Functionalities

## Architecture and design
The application follows a modern iOS 26 architecture built around SwiftUI for the user interface and Core Data for persistent data storage. SwiftUI ensures that views automatically update in response to underlying data changes, while Core Data manages user information, tasks, and progression. To maintain code quality and consistency across the project, SwiftLint is integrated, enforcing style guidelines and helping prevent common programming errors.
